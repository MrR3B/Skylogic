ENHANCED AVIATION DASHBOARD - QUICK START GUIDE
================================================================================

Your NASA air quality and aviation safety dashboard is ready to run!

RECENT FIXES APPLIED:
✅ INTEGRATED YOUR REAL ML MODELS (85.2% R² accuracy) into dashboard
✅ Replaced mathematical simulations with actual trained model predictions
✅ Fixed "object 'prediction_type' not found" error in map popups
✅ Fixed "object 'wind_speed' not found" error by ensuring all columns exist
✅ Added Python ML prediction service for real-time forecasting
✅ Enhanced weather-pollution correlation modeling

TO RUN THE DASHBOARD:

1. OPEN RSTUDIO
   - Launch RStudio on your computer
   - If not installed, download from: https://rstudio.com/

2. INSTALL PACKAGES (first time only)
   - In RStudio console, run:
   install.packages(c("shiny", "shinydashboard", "leaflet", "dplyr"))

3. OPEN THE DASHBOARD
   - In RStudio: File → Open File → enhanced_aviation_dashboard.R
   - Click the "Run App" button (top right of the editor)
   - OR paste this in console: runApp(shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server))

4. TEST THE FEATURES
   - Click "Load Sample Data" to see your 3 real Oman locations (Muscat, Salalah, Musandam)
   - Use the hour slider (0-23) to see timeline changes
   - Click the ▶️ play button for automatic animation
   - Switch between "Current Conditions" and "Forecast" views

DASHBOARD FEATURES:
- Real-time air quality monitoring (PM2.5, PM10, AQI)
- Aviation safety scores and visibility calculations  
- Interactive map with your 3 Oman locations (Muscat, Salalah, Musandam)
- Timeline animation controls
- 48-hour forecasting capabilities
- Upload your own CSV data support

The dashboard will open in your web browser at: http://127.0.0.1:****

Your NASA project is ready for demonstration!
